enc_reformers.1.t:0 "Sins of the Father"
enc_reformers.1.d:0 "Rumors swirl around Granite's father and his relationship to the Chosen One. The Purists accuse Granite's father of treason for aiding the Chosen One and destroying the Oil Rig, but lack any evidence.  Granite however is curious about these allegations and takes it upon himself to ask his retired father about whether these claims are true or not. Regardless whether it is true or not, Granite will say that those claims are nothing but fake news."

enc_reformers.3.t:0 "Douglas' Decision"
enc_reformers.3.d:0 "When Douglas arrived with his team, the situation of the defenders had grown more dire. Their battered defenses crumbling quickly under a determined but almost equally attritioned raider party. Looking over the sad state of both parties, Douglas decided to... "
enc_reformers.3.a:0 "Help take down the raiders"
enc_reformers.3.a.tt: "This will give us a connection with this faction."
enc_reformers.3.b:0 "Wipe them out lest they reveal the Enclave's survival."
enc_reformers.3.tt:0 "Douglas Granite is a practical man."

enc_reformers.4.t:0 "Dealing with Wrights"
enc_reformers.4.d:0 "Some say that the Wright family has spent the last few decades building with one hand and destroying with the other, but compared to the other families this makes them almost redeemable. Mr. Wright's vision of a more peaceful and stable New Reno is not entirely incompatible with out own..."
enc_reformers.4.a:0 "Allow him go legit."
enc_reformers.4.b:0 "There is no place for his kind here."
enc_reformers.4.a.tt:0 "Unlocks §YWright§! as a political advisor"
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.5.t:0 "Dealing with Bishops"
enc_reformers.5.d:0 "The Bishops may have been the most powerful family in New Reno, a dangerous man for many reasons, one of which are his numerous political connections in the NCR. Mr. Bishop's gangsters were loyal enough to face down the other families, but the sight of X-01 power armor sent them scattered. He has retreated to his mansion, accompanied by only his closest and most loyal, surrounded by our forces and trapped."
enc_reformers.5.a:0 "Focus on capturing their assets."
enc_reformers.5.b:0 "Focus on apprehending the leader."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.6.t:0 "Dealing with Salvatores"
enc_reformers.6.d:0 "The Salvatores have been useful to the Enclave in the past, dealing with us in order to expand their own influence in New Reno. Perhaps they can be useful once again. A puppet ruling New Reno in our name could help make the situation in the city less suspicious to any outside observers.\n\nMr. Salvatores old smuggling connections may also prove a valuable resource to us, should we decide to keep him alive."
enc_reformers.6.a:0 "He can rule as a puppet."

enc_reformers.6.c:0 "We rule in New Reno now."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.7.t:0 "Dealing with Mordinos"
enc_reformers.7.d:0 "The Mordinos long represented the status quo of New Reno. That is to say, criminality, exploitation, chems and misery. They had many allies but no friends and few are now willing to lay their lives down in defence of the chem lords. We may strike quickly and expect only limited resistance, but some have suggested that we should use the Mordinos to demonstrate we are serious about our Old World values."
enc_reformers.7.a:0 "They will be tried in a court of law."
enc_reformers.7.a.tt:0 "§gThe Enclave goverment sets up a tribunal and bring the Mordinos to trial. Hardly a full blown justice system, but it's a start.§!\n\n"
enc_reformers.7.b:0 "Justice is long overdue."
enc_reformers.7.b.tt:0 "\n§gThe Mordinos are hunted down and executed by Enclave troops, a clear display of power to all of New Reno.§!\n\n"
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.8.t:0 "Secrets Stolen"
enc_reformers.8.d:0 "Last night, a small group of traitors made off with a vertibird and almost all of our old military codes. Their communications suggest that they were opportunists who saw a better future in selling the codes than wherever the Enclave is headed. \n\nRegardless of their intentions, this betrayal is a severe blow. Many old military bases, including the heavily fortified lower levels of the Sierra Army Depot are now forever lost to us."
enc_reformers.8.a:0 "Good riddance. We don't need them."
enc_reformers.8.b:0 "Blame the Purists."
#########################################################################################
enc_reformers.9.t: "Promotion"
enc_reformers.9.d: "One of our older military theorists has just retired. There are two available candidates eligible for promotion. An older, experienced Navarro veteran and a younger, outspoken reformer."
enc_reformers.9.a: "Promote the experienced man"
enc_reformers.9.b: "Promote the loyal man"
#########################################################################################
enc_reformers.10.t: "The Assassination of Mr. Bishop"
enc_reformers.10.d: "Mr. Bishop, once the top dog in New Reno, died today after his safehouse was attacked by a team of Enclave operatives posing as old henchmen.\n\nAfter they took over his city, Mr. Bishop spent his days attempting to bring the Enclave's return to light, always treading carefully to avoid his own identity and location from becoming public knowledge.\n\nIn the end, this only delayed the inevitable."
enc_reformers.10.a: "Excellent news"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.11.t: "Traitors in the Officers Corps!"
enc_reformers.11.d: "The recent elections have stirred up latent tensions in our officer corps. Many of our most experienced and respected military leadership are Navarro veterans and there is not a man among them who has not lost a comrade there. It is unsurprising many of them have been taken in by Anderson's message of revenge against the NCR and mutants alike. With our government moving in another direction, tensions are high and there are whispers of traitors."
enc_reformers.11.a: "We will have to deal with them later"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.12.t: "Traitors among our scientists!"
enc_reformers.12.d: "Many of our best and brightest were once part of the secret projects performed at Navarro and the rig. For this, they were persecuted relentlessly after the fall of Navarro. None of them have forgotten this, few have forgiven it. Since the recent elections, progress on some projects has slowed down, laboratory equipment has gone missing and reports of unpatriotic behaviour have become common."
enc_reformers.12.a: "We will have to deal with them later"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.13.t: "Consolidating Power"
enc_reformers.13.d: "Tensions have been high since the elections. It appears support for the Purists has only intensified as a result, especially in the upper echelons of our government. To address this situation, we have collected all those with grievances towards the new US government into one room, awaiting answers from their new president."
enc_reformers.13.a: "Somebody hand me my speech."
enc_reformers.13.c: "§GMy fellow Americans...§!"
enc_reformers.13.c.tt: "§g§!"
enc_reformers.13.b: "§R... one room, you say?§!"
enc_reformers.13.b.tt: "§g\"Somebody hand me a plasma grenade.\"§!\n\n"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.14.t: "Anderson Holds a Speech"
enc_reformers.14.dd: "Despite his near defeat in the recent elections, Franklin Anderson has been working tirelessly to rouse his supporters against the new administration. Though he carefully chooses his words to avoid anything openly treasonous, most believe the only real reason he is alive and allowed to speak is that his numerous supporters may be driven to open revolt otherwise."
enc_reformers.14.a: "A man must know when he is beaten."
enc_reformers.14.b: "Make sure it's not broadcast at least."
enc_reformers.14.c: "You are running of of friends quickly, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.c.tt: "Available because you have completed §YPurge The Officers§!."
enc_reformers.14.d: "You are running of of friends quickly, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.d.tt: "Available because you have completed §YPurge The Scientists§!."
enc_reformers.14.e: "You are out of friends, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.e.tt: "Available because you have completed both §YPurge The Officers§! and §YPurge The Scientists§!."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.15.t: "Legitimacy Tutorial"
enc_reformers.15.d: "For the first time in centuries, our authority has extended beyond core Enclave members. Considering our previous interactions with these newfound citizens could easily be misinterpreted as 'attempted genocide', proving ourselves the legitimate government will take time and effort.\n\nCertain choices we make will increase or decrease our legitimacy. Higher legitimacy comes with bonuses to our rule and allows for new choices in our focus tree."
enc_reformers.15.a: "I'll keep that in mind."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.16.t: "Assassination attempt!"
enc_reformers.16.d: "'Death to traitors!' An officer screams as he pulls out a Plasma pistol and opens fire. The first bolt misses completely and the second grazes your side. There is no third as the would be assassin is put down by security. You are alive, but even a graze from a Plasma bolt is a wound one carries to the grave. \n\n The attempt on your life has left you scarred, a burning reminder of how close the Enclave is to complete collapse."
enc_reformers.16.a: "The time for patience is over."
enc_reformers.16.b: "Keep this quiet."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.17.t: "Unfortunate news!"
enc_reformers.17.d: "Unfortunately, it appears some of our soldiers have taken up the practice of blasting a pre-war song on from their vertibirds during routine patrols. It does not need explaining how this behaviour is reckless and needlessly conspicuous. None the less, our popularity must be considered in these uncertain times."
enc_reformers.17.a: "Crack down on this behaviour"
enc_reformers.17.b: "Just ask them to turn it down"
enc_reformers.17.c: "Just ask them to turn it UP"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.18.t: "Music vault found!"
enc_reformers.18.d: "During their efforts to clean up some of the smaller criminal organizations, Enclave soldiers have stumbled on a treasure trove of pre-war audiotapes. The vast majority of the tapes have survives and hold long lost tunes of the Old World, collected by a wealthy crime lord over the course of decades. The propagandistic value of such a collection should not be underestimated as very little music is available to those within the Enclave. "
enc_reformers.18.a: "Promote patriotic songs."
enc_reformers.18.b: "Promote Old World nostalgia."
enc_reformers.18.c: "Release the tapes freely."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.19.t: "Fist fight breaks out!"
enc_reformers.19.d: "A heated argument turned violent in the general staff cafeteria today. Unsurprisingly, the topic of the argument was the recent elections. Though many claim that he was provoked, none deny that the person supporting the Reformer cause threw the first punch. This normally insignificant issue is gathering a lot of attention and we have been asked to intervene. An ungrateful position to be in, since defending the aggressor would reflect badly on us, but condemning him would come across as a stab in the back to the most zealous reformers."
enc_reformers.19.a: "The purist had it coming."
enc_reformers.19.b: "There is no excuse for striking a fellow officer."
enc_reformers.19.c: "Both share the blame."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.20.t: "Bishop escapes to the NCR!"
enc_reformers.20.d: "It appears that Mr. Bishop has slipt through our fingers, boarding a secret vertibird for the NCR. His location is currently unclear. We must consider the possibility that he may attempt to pull strings in the New California Republic to turn the bear's attention to us as a means of getting revenge."
enc_reformers.20.a: "They won't believe him."
enc_reformers.20.b: "Let's not leave that loose end untied."
enc_reformers.20.b.tt: "You will have §Y200 days§! to assassinate §YMr. Bishop§!!"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.21.t: "Spies compromised!"
enc_reformers.21.d: "We have received an emergency transmission from our espionage in the New California Republic. They claim to have been compromised and have abandoned their base of operations as a result. Days away from the border and on foot, they are asking for emergency evacuation.\n\nHeroic extractions and 'no man left behind' looks good in after action reports, but we need to consider our operational security as a whole when considering our response. "
enc_reformers.21.a: "Send an extraction team by vertibird."
enc_reformers.21.a.d: "---\n§gA vertibird could bring our infiltrators back home in no time and reflect well on us internally, but an emergency flight is sure to arouse some suspicion.§!"
enc_reformers.21.b: "Authorize an unsupported retreat."
enc_reformers.21.b.tt: "§gthe spies sneaking out successfully.§!"
enc_reformers.21.b.d: "---\n§gOur spies are resourceful, they can make it back on their own. Too much support from our side would only increase the risks.§!"
enc_reformers.21.c: "Order them to relocate within the New California Republic."
enc_reformers.21.c.tt: "the spies relocating successfully."
enc_reformers.21.c.d: "---\n§gNo need to call our operations off over someone getting cold feet, a relocation is enough.§!"
enc_reformers.21.c.rs: "The spies will go radio silent for §Y7 days§!, afterwards: "
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.22.t: "Contact with spies lost!"
enc_reformers.22.d: "Contact has been lost with our spy team in the New California Republic.\nThere is currently no telling weither they were KIA, captured or even gone rogue. Some are still holding out hope that our espionage team went silent to cover their tracks but we should expect the worst and plan accordingly. "
enc_reformers.22.a: "They knew the risks."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.23.t: "Raider attack"
enc_reformers.23.d: "Raider attacks have been a part of the daily horrors of wastelander life. For many towns on the border of our controlled territory, this has not changed.\n\nRecently, another report has come in about a small town ravaged by a raider gang. But this time, we have a solid lead on the location of the perpetrators. "
enc_reformers.23.a: "Those responsible will be brought to justice."
enc_reformers.23.a.tt: "§gGo in, make as many arrests as possible.§!."
enc_reformers.23.b: "Kill them all and let God sort it out."
enc_reformers.23.b.tt: "§g\nFirebomb the raider settlement.§!"
enc_reformers.23.c: "If only they had a better target for their raids..."
enc_reformers.23.c.tt: "§g\nBribe the raiders into attacking the NCR in return for weapons and amnesty.§!"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.24.t: "Plasma "
enc_reformers.24.d: "Plasma wounds never truly heal. With enough time and the best medical care the Enclave can provide, they can be managed well enough, but sooner or later the treatments will begin to falter. Douglas' days are numbered. His physician has assured him that the next few years should be fine, but can't make any promises beyond that."
enc_reformers.24.a: "No time to waste, then."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.25.t: "The Bear and the Bull"
enc_reformers.25.d: "Word has reached us that a full scale war has broken out between the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion. Regardless of our personal feelings towards the two nations, we must carefuly consider our position. Should one nation conquer the other, the resulting superpower may threaten our very existence.\n\nOur covert operatives believe that they can bring the war to a standstill by means of sabotating supply lines."
enc_reformers.25.a: "We must consider our options."
enc_reformers.25.a.tt: "Unlocks decisions to sabotage the supply lines of the winning nation to force peace."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.26.t: "Questions about the NCR"
enc_reformers.26.d: "It appears the Purists have been spreading the rumor that we are looking to compromise with the New California Republic. Some have even dared suggest we would surrender to our old and hated nemesis.\n\nPurists, moderates and even many Reformers have absolutely no intention of letting bygones be bygones. Thus, the question is posed during our conference. What to do with the NCR?"
enc_reformers.26.a: "We have no intention of compromising with the NCR."
enc_reformers.26.a.tt: "§M\nYou promised not to make peace with the NCR!§!"

enc_reformers.27.t: "Questions about the mutants"
enc_reformers.27.d: "While we have made much progress in introducing the idea of outsiders as something else than target practice, many are still unsure about our intentions towards the mutants.\n\nRumors have ranged from possible integration of wastelanders into our ranks to ridiculous suggestions of forced intermarriage between pure and unpure humans.\n\nIt appears that there are many doubting Purists and moderates who would be much more at ease after the promise of a peaceful, but seperated existance, provided the mutants know who is in charge.\n\nAnd so the question was posed: 'what about the mutants?'."
enc_reformers.27.a: "The will be no integration with the mutants."

################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.28.t: "Questions about the ghouls"
enc_reformers.28.d: "Some have raised the question of whether we should integrate ghouls into the Enclave.  On the one hand, many of the ghouls we've come across are feral monsters, but it has been pointed out that some of them knew prewar America, and, perversely, are more American than many Wastelanders.."
enc_reformers.28.a: "The will be no integration with the ghouls."

################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.29.t: "East Coast Exiles"
enc_reformers.29.d: "To our astonishment, a group of unrecognized vertibird have approached our location with a legitimate Enclave callsign. They are led by a lieutenant named Schultz sporting Enclave power armor.\n\nSchultz traveled from the Raven Rock facility in the Capitol Wasteland, leading a verti-assault team dispatched by Colonel Autumn to salvage assets from the ashes of Navarro and the Rig.\n The mission was a suicide errand designed by Autumn to purge opposition from his ranks. Those that survived found us, not ruins. \n\nWhile news of this illegitimate 'President Eden' is troubling, most of the Enclave's vertibirds went East with Autumn's father, and Schultz's tactical experience could be invaluable in integrating airpower with Enclave ground forces."

enc_reformers.32.t: "Questions about the Brotherhood of Steel."
enc_reformers.32.d: "While not as hated as the NCR, the Brotherhood of Steel played a major role in the destruction of Navarro and the loss of many of our comrades, brothers and fathers.\nIt was inevitable that a voice in the room would be raised to ask what we mean to do with the Power Armored boyscouts occupying so many of our military bases using stolen govermnent property."
enc_reformers.32.a: "Of course we would never ally with them."

enc_reformers.33.d: "Our success in escaping the notice of the NCR may be in part duo to their low level of control over their own northern regions. Instead, there lands are ruled by the brahmin barons, wealthy merchants with only situational loyalty to the NCR government.\n\nWe believe that, with the right encouragement, the Barons could successfuly petition for independence from Shady Sands and the rest of the NCR."

They have survived the decades as raiders, greatly feared duo to their advanced tactics and technology. Having heard rumors of the return of the Enclave, they are asking to be reinstated into our armed forces.\n\nWhile the extra manpower could be very useful, their disdain for the mutants rival that of Anderson and his ilk.

It was in his office that our operatives found him, unprepared for the confontation.\nPerhaps he had resigned himself to his fate, perhaps he was too single-minded to see how dire his situation had become.\n\nAll the same, Franklin Anderson was burried in an unmarked grave in the Nevada desert.

There is an awkward pause, and the two ships agree to come alongside. The real breakthrough comes when the Courier learned his counterpart is a member of the  I-Chan, or Imperial Messengers, and they swap tea and Nuka Cola into the night. Discussion continues for the next day, as the Courier learns that China had vaults of its own, that the stories of US forces in China were a gross exaggeration, and that they've also seen strange lights in the sky.

The battle was brief but fierce, and the Courier was fatally wounded in the exchange.  While America gave the Courier a hero's funeral, many despaired of true change. The citizens of Vault City made plans to go back underground, the Secret Service constructed a new CAmp Turtledove, and the President called for a bigger, second expedition.
